# constrained-denoising-EB-OT

This repository recreates the figures appearing in the paper "Constrained Denoising, Empirical Bayes, and Optimal Transport" by Adam Quinn Jaffe, Nikolaos Ignatiadis, and Bodhisattva Sen, which can be accessed at [arxiv/2506.09986](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09986). The Jupyter notebooks all run in Python 3.9.13, and they use POT version 0.9.5, CVXPY version 1.3.2, and Mosek version 11.0.5.
